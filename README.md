## A website that displays a list of books - using React.
Books are a very important part of everyone’s life. So it is very important that books should be available for everyone. Sometimes, there are cases where certain books are available only in certain areas.
 In order to avoid such situations and make books accessible to everyone, it's a website that solves this issue by providing books online.

## The following API in order to fetch all the books.

Api: https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com/books

headers: { 'Authorization': 'whatever-you-want' }

## Constraints for every field are given below:

1. Name: The name should not be greater than 30 characters and less than 3 characters.
2. Email: The email must be a valid email. A valid email address ( for this assessment ) is that address, which has an “@” symbol.
3. Password: The password should be at least 10 characters long, with at least one special character.
4. Repeat your password: The value of this field must match the value of the Password field.
5. Register button: This button should not work if any of the above constraints are not being followed or if any one of the fields is not filled.
6. Search bar: As you must have observed in the final output image, there is a search bar as well. The functionality of the search bar is to filter out the books based on the text written in the search bar. So for eg, if I search “The Great” → then all the books starting with these two words should be displayed on the screen.
